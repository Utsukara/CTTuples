# Apply loops and tuples to track and report on event attendance.

# Problem Statement:
# Your goal is to manage an attendance system for various events. 
# Each attendee's data is stored as a tuple containing their name and the event they attended.

# Develop a function to list all attendees of a specific event.
# Implement a feature to count the number of attendees for each event.
# Example Attendee Data:

attendees = [
    ("Alice", "Python Conference"),
    ("Bob", "Python Conference"),
    ("Charlie", "AI Summit"),
    # More attendees...
]
